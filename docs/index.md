# Trinsic Documentation
## Issue and verify universally-accepted digital credentials.
Welcome to Trinsic, the proof-of-anything platform. We are the leading developer platform for implementing verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers, new web standards for building next-gen digital identity systems. 

Learn how to issue and verify universally-accepted digital credentials so that anywhere people go online or in-person, they can simply tap their phone, prove who they are, and get what they need.

[**Join the Beta**](early-adopter.md) - Our platform is still in beta. While our docs are public, you'll need a special environment to start using Trinsic at this time. We're excited to help you! Please contact us and we'll help you get started.

[**Get started with Trinsic**](learn/index.md) - Learn about Trinsic, work through a basic implementation, plan a full implementation and learn about our tools you can use.
