We make it easy for people and organizations to prove things about themselves with technology instead of paper documents. Our software is based on Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), a new digital identity standard. Using Trinsic, organizations and their customers share data between each other in a trustworthy, standardized, and privacy-preserving way without requiring a centralized server or database. We make all of this possible by signing, sharing and storing verifiable data within identity wallets owned by individuals. People can easily share them with others to prove things about themselves anywhere. Learn how to issue and verify universally-accepted digital credentials so that anywhere people go online or in-person, they can simply tap their phone, prove who they are, and get what they need. Our Products \u00b6 Trinsic Core \u00b6 Trinsic Core is infrastructure for digital trust. It's our set of APIs for sending verifiable data between digital identity wallets. Core gives people and organizations the ability to easily and securely prove things about themselves with digital credentials. With Core, you can transform credentials, licenses, passes, and certificates into a W3C standard format that can be exchanged digitally and verified instantly by anyone called a \"verifiable credential\". Trinsic Ecosystems \u00b6 A layer built on top of Core, Trinsic Ecosystems is a product for organizations that want to build an ecosystem of different issuers, holders, and verifiers of credentials. By ecosystem, we mean a network of companies and consumers that need to be able to securely share and instantly verify data. At Trinsic, we call the organizations that bring together these ecosystems of companies and customers \"providers\" since they are providing digital trust to the ecosystem through Trinsic's infrastructure.

VCs provide a standard for digitally issuing, holding, and verifying data about a subject. A verifiable credential is a set of tamper-evident claims and metadata that cryptographically prove who issued it. https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/ Verifiable credentials are unique from other kinds of digital documents because they enable you to verify the following things: The original issuing entity (the source of the data) It was issued to the entity presenting it (the subject of the data) It hasn't been tampered with (the veracity of the data) Whether the issuer revoked the credential as of a particular point in time (the status of the data) trust triangle Components of a Credential \u00b6 To break down the components of a credential, we'll use a digital driver's license as an example. Issuer DID \u00b6 As you can see from the diagram above, a verifier will only accept a credential if they trust its source. For example, in the United States a TSA agent will only let you on an airplane if you present a valid driver's license (or other gov ID); they do this because they trust the DMV or other agency that issued it. In order to validate where a credential came from, verifiers use the issuer's DID . Each new issuer is assigned an issuer DID. The issuer DID acts as a public-facing address or public key . In self-sovereign identity, these DIDs are usually written to a public blockchain, but other locations are possible, too. Each issuer DID has an associated private key which is used to cryptographically \"sign\" each issued credential. In fact, each attribute inside the credential is signed in this manner, allowing the holder of the credential to share only a subset of the attributes when desired. For example, someone could share their name and age from their driver's license without sharing the driver's license number, address, and hair color. Using the issuer DID and straightforward public-private key cryptography, anyone can verify the attributes in the credential were attested to by the issuer. Schema \u00b6 Each credential needs a template so the data can be shared and interpreted correctly. That template is called a Schema. Schemas are the general structure of the credential. In our example, they tell us what information must be included on the driver's license in order for it to be valid, like Full name, Address, Eye color, etc. In short, they are the attributes that you want to include in this credential. Example: \u00b6 { \"$schema\" : \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\" , \"description\" : \"Email\" , \"type\" : \"object\" , \"properties\" : { \"emailAddress\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" , \"format\" : \"email\" } }, \"required\" : [ \"emailAddress\" ], \"additionalProperties\" : false } Schemas are nonproprietary; any issuer can view/use the schemas written by any other issuer. We abstract schema creation away into the same action as creation of a credential template. Keep reading to read how to create a schema and credential template. Verifications \u00b6 Passes are documents generated from credentials that contain only the information required to be verified. They can be generated in advance or in real-time. Passes minimize the information about you that is shared with third parties. Credentials are signed using BLS keys. These create from the credential fields.","title":"Credentials"},{"location":"learn/credentials/#what-are-verifiable-credentials","text":"\"Verifiable Credentials\", or \"VCs\" are digital documents that conform to the W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model.

Aligning standards and incentives is challenging. We've made it simple to create an ecosystem of participants to all exchange credentials. Potential Scenarios \u00b6 Industry groups, enterprises, and startups who are deploying this technology to multi-party ecosystems. Our focus on building for interoperability, hyper-scalability, and ease of use means you can get to market faster with a better product with Trinsic than any other way. Trust ecosystems are networks of participants that can authenticate to and share data with one another. Trust ecosystems exist all around us, but most are analog and disaggregated. The first trust ecosystems to go digital were payments networks. Visa, MasterCard, etc. introduced a standard mechanism to allow consumers to make purchases with any merchant using credit from any bank. Visa created an enduring business while simultaneously unlocking value for all participants involved. Credit card networks represent only one kind of trust ecosystem. A trust ecosystem at a minimum has the following 4 roles. Provider - provides the tools and rules to the rest of the participants to ensure a healthy ecosystem, generally through a product experience that is sold to the other participants Issuer - is the source of data that is shared throughout an ecosystem Verifier - consumes data in an ecosystem Holder - holds data, and is generally the subject of the data, in an ecosystem Anatomy of a Trust Ecosystem \u00b6 Before diving into the value provided by each participant, it\u2019s helpful to cover how it works at a high level. You may dive deeper into any of these items by clicking into the respective pages. We\u2019ll use the analogy of a payment network to conceptualize the purpose of each component. Wallet - A place to securely store verifiable credentials. Credential - W3C Verifiable Credentials that contain valuable data about a subject. These are signed and issued by an issuer. Pass - A presentation of a verifiable credential that only includes the information required for use case. Underlying Tech - All of the additional standardized technology Trinsic uses to build trust ecosystems. Value of Trust Ecosystems to Participants \u00b6 The first step to successfully building a trust ecosystem that can scale is to identify the value for each of the participants. Here we will elaborate on the value derived by each actor in an ecosystem and how Trinsic\u2019s platform is optimized to help deliver it. Providers \u00b6 Providers typically already have, or are building, a product or platform to sell to the issuers and verifiers with the goal of creating a sustainable business. Visa, for example, isn\u2019t a currency, a bank, or a merchant. They sell the rails for transaction settlement to banks and merchants to enable the seamless transactions we all enjoy. By taking a small interchange fee, they capture value alongside the banks and merchants and have built a sustainable business. Trinsic is the only company to offer a product tailored specifically for providers. That means instead of patching together various open source components meant for issuers or verifiers, Trinsic offers a product built from the ground-up to accommodate the unique needs of providers. Ultimately, that means providers using Trinsic get to market faster with better products. Issuers \u00b6 Issuers realize value when they extend or augment their existing business operations. By issuing the data they already have in verifiable credential form, they often can increase revenue, reduce verification costs, and improve brand presence. When credit cards were in their infancy, banks began issuing cards because it allowed them to continue their existing business (giving credit) in a new way. Likewise, the issuers that get the most value from verifiable credentials are ones who already have data about people, and simply need to give it to them in a new way (e.g. medical labs who already give paper documents can now give digital form). Trinsic\u2019s platform is optimized to both reduce onboarding costs and add help issuers scale without increasing their costs Before credit cards banks could offer various consumer loans Holders \u00b6 Holders acquire the most convenient way to prove something about themselves digitally, both in-person and online Before credit cards, consumers needed to pay with paper. Paying with credit meant bespoke processes with each individual retailer (e.g. opening a tab at a bar, creating a Macy\u2019s account, etc). Likewise today our digital identities are all siloed and separate, resulting in a myriad of problems for consumers. Verifiers \u00b6 Verifiers get instant, trusted authentication and verification without needing to maintain their own infrastructure Before credit card networks like Visa, merchants needed to issue credit and manage collections in-house if they wanted customers who could buy on credit. Likewise, companies in virtually every industry have compliance, risk, and identity departments where they manage this in-house. Just as Visa turned electronic payments into a simple terminal installation for merchants, so too will trust ecosystems unlock the ability for verifiers of all kinds to focus on their true business without compromising on trust and security.

And like the internet itself, the vast majority of the value will be created at the application layer.","title":"Identity Ecosystems"},{"location":"learn/ecosystems/#ecosystems","text":"Exchanging credentials often requires many different participants to all communicate and collaborate.

You can use Trinsic to give your end-users identity wallets and then share, store, and verify data through them. Wallets \u00b6 Identity Wallets are secure, partitioned data stores for information that needs to get verified. This normally is a person, but it can also be an organization or a device. You can use Trinsic's platform to invite end-users to create a cloud-hosted identity wallet that can be accessed on any device using multi-factor passwordless authentication. Once created, applications and organizations can issue data to the identity wallet. Other applications can request to verify information from the wallet. If the end-user accepts the request, a proof of the requested information will be created and sent to the requester. Using identity wallets, you can build powerful products that preserve your end-user's privacy without compromising on convenience. Wallet Service Credentials & Proofs \u00b6 Trinsic's wallets are built to represent verifiable data as credentials. This allows any information sent to the identity wallet to be easily verified using interoperable standards. Because we follow a standardized open data model, identity wallets can bridge software platforms, letting individuals use their data wherever they choose. To minimize the amount of information that is requested from identity wallets, a credential's attributes can be filtered to generate a proof of the credential with only the data required to fulfill a verifier's request. Credential Service Templates \u00b6 Credential templates let you publish a credential format for other's to follow. There are often more than one issuer of the same type of credential, and this allows issuers to reuse the same credential format and share the same attribute types. When data models can be reused, more interoperability can be achieved between different systems. This let's data that previously had to be manually entered via form or sent via custom API integration get automatically exchanged and verified without needing human interaction. Template Service Trust Registries \u00b6 A trust registry is a way for a wallet to publish a list of other wallets that it trusts to issue and verifier credentials. This is useful when building trust without a centralized service or database. If you onboard wallets, it is likely that the wallet holders already have a connection with you. You can publish a list of issuers and verifiers that you've also vetted and onboarded and the wallet holders can reference this list before receiving or sharing their information with another wallet. When verifying a credential, a verifier can cross-reference the issuer's identifier within the credential with a trust registry to ensure it was actually issued by an organization that they trust. Trust Registry Service Ecosystems \u00b6 When creating a product that uses identity wallets, it is useful to have the tools to onboard participants that want to either issue, store, or verify credentials. Trinsic Ecosystems is a set of tools built so you can invite participants to an ecosystem and configure their wallets for them. This makes it possible to quickly go live with a proof of concept or pilot without requiring your ecosystem participants to do any setup or integrations themselves. Provider Service Open Standards \u00b6 Trinsic's technology is all based on open web standards. Our goal is to promote a future of applications where identity and personal data is independent from applications. To meet this end, we use decentralized identifiers that can be generated and resolved without needing a centralized database. We also follow the data model for verifiable credentials so that data sent by one application can be presented at another without requiring a specific vendor. Learn More Security and Privacy \u00b6 As a hosting provider of identity wallets, we've recognized the need for strong security and privacy since before we started building. Our identity wallets are secured using zero knowledge authentication. No private keys are stored or processed on our servers. They are all generated locally by our SDKs. We do this using a lightweight zero-knowledge proof protocol. Even if an adversary were to intercept a payload, they would not be able to reuse the token to gain additional access to our system.

All secrets are stored with the user client and are entirely in their control. During authentication, users present proof of knowledge of these secret tokens, instead of the actual tokens. This proof is generated with each request and is unique for that request only. Zero-knowledge Architecture \u00b6 TODO: Comparison to traditional security models Oberon Auth Scheme \u00b6 A succinct ZKP protocol for authentication. It works by using techniques similar to Identity-Based/Attribute-Based signatures. Oberon allows endpoints to issue multi-factor capable tokens to consumers who can prove their validity without disclosing the tokens themselves and without requiring email, SMS, or authenticator apps. Endpoints only need to store a single public key and not any tokens. An attacker that breaks into the server doesn't have any password/token files to steal and only would see a public key.

Our intention with this design is to bring it closer to interoperability as more implementations of this wallet appear in production. Create Wallet \u00b6 Wallets can be created directly by the user or through an invitation by the ecosystem provider.

To specify the size of the result set (page size) use the LIMIT clause. SELECT * FROM c OFFSET 10 LIMIT 5 Sorting \u00b6 The optional ORDER BY clause specifies the sorting order for results returned by the query. To control sorting order, specify ASC or DESC at the end; if not specified ascending order is used by default. SELECT * FROM c ORDER BY c . credential . issued DESC Filtering \u00b6 The optional WHERE clause ( WHERE <filter_condition> ) specifies condition(s) that the source JSON items must satisfy for the query to include them in results. A JSON item must evaluate the specified conditions to true to be considered for the result. The index layer uses the WHERE clause to determine the smallest subset of source items that can be part of the result. SELECT * FROM c WHERE c . name = 'Trinsic' AND c . dateCreated >= \"2020-09-30T23:14:25.7251173Z\" Grouping \u00b6 The GROUP BY clause divides the query's results according to the values of one or more specified properties.

Feel free to follow along in a terminal using the CLI. We'll cover each part of Trinsic's platform during the tutorial. Meet Allison \u00b6 In this walkthrough we'll explore a scenario where Allison gets her vaccination certificate. She then uses this certificate to board an airline that requires proof of vaccination. In most credential exchange scenarios there are three primary roles - Issuer, Holder, and Verifier. Holder : Stores issued credentials from an issuer. Most often this is the credential subject. Also generates passes to share with verifiers. Issuer : Responsible for issuing signed credentials that attest information about a credential subject Verifier : Verifies passes presented from holders. In this case, Allison will be the holder, a vaccination clinic will be an issuer, and an airline will be the verifier. walkthrough |- allison - Holder |- clinic - Issuer |- airline - Verifier Our SDKs \u00b6 This tutorial is meant to share the concepts of verifiable credentials. So feel free to sit back and read through this without running any code. However, you can also follow along using one of our SDKs. We've set up some environments to use on Repl.it. If your language of choice isn't supported on repl.it, you can also run locally by installing the SDK of your choice.

Once the CLI is installed, clone our CLI example repository on Github to download the credential data for this walkthrough. git clone https://github.com/trinsic-id/cli-example && cd cli-example If you don't want to install locally, we also have a replit environment for you to use.

Installation instructions for Python. Installation instructions for Java. In this project, we'll be following along the java/src/test/java/trinsic/VaccineDemo.java in our SDK repository Install Instructions Install Instructions Creating Accounts \u00b6 We'll start by creating a Trinsic Wallet for each participant in this credential exchange. Wallets can be created by anyone, for anyone. In this scenario, we'll have three wallets. Allison will be the credential holder, the Airline will be the verifier, and the vaccination clinic will be the issuer. When a new Trinsic account is created, a cloud wallet is created on our platform and an authentication key is generated by our SDK locally. Each person is the sole owner of their cloud wallet. They're meant to be easy to create so that you can create a cloud wallet for an end-user in your UX with very little friction. Trinsic CLI Typescript C# Python Java Go The CLI offers an interactive way of creating wallets. For demo purposes, we'll create all three on the same machine. However, this demo could be done with all three wallets created on three separate machines. When creating a wallet in the CLI, the wallet will store a private authentication token for the wallet in ~/.trinsic. If using the CLI with a real-world wallet, store this authentication token somewhere securely. trinsic account login --description \"Allison's Wallet\" --alias allison && \\ trinsic account login --description \"Airline's wallet\" --alias airline && \\ trinsic account login --description \"Vaccination Clinic\" --alias clinic // Create 3 different profiles for each participant in the scenario const allison = await accountService . signIn ( new SignInRequest ()); const clinic = await accountService . signIn ( new SignInRequest ()); const airline = await accountService . signIn ( new SignInRequest ()); var allison = await accountService .

This certificate is digitally signed by the clinic, acting as an issuer. The certificate is in a JSON form, and for this example, we will use the following JSON. Add this file to your project named vaccination-certificate-unsigned.jsonld . vaccination-certificate-unsigned.jsonld { \"@context\" : [ \"https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1\" , \"https://w3id.org/vaccination/v1\" , \"https://w3id.org/security/bbs/v1\" ], \"id\" : \"urn:uvci:af5vshde843jf831j128fj\" , \"type\" : [ \"VaccinationCertificate\" , \"VerifiableCredential\" ], \"description\" : \"COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate\" , \"name\" : \"COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate\" , \"expirationDate\" : \"2029-12-03T12:19:52Z\" , \"issuanceDate\" : \"2019-12-03T12:19:52Z\" , \"issuer\" : \"did:key:zUC724vuGvHpnCGFG1qqpXb81SiBLu3KLSqVzenwEZNPoY35i2Bscb8DLaVwHvRFs6F2NkNNXRcPWvqnPDUd9ukdjLkjZd3u9zzL4wDZDUpkPAatLDGLEYVo8kkAzuAKJQMr7N2\" , \"credentialSubject\" : { \"id\" : \"urn:uuid:c53e70f8-ce9a-4576-8744-e5f85c20a743\" , \"type\" : \"VaccinationEvent\" , \"batchNumber\" : \"1183738569\" , \"countryOfVaccination\" : \"US\" } } Behind the scenes, each credential is a JSON document that is signed with a special digital signature to make each piece of data in the credential separately verifiable. Signatures are a way to make sure that credentials are not forged or tampered with between getting issued and verified. They also are how a verifier can know that the credential was issued by who the credential says it was issued by. To issue this credential we'll specify links to the json files, set the active profile to the clinic, and call the issuance endpoint: Trinsic CLI Typescript C# Python Java Go trinsic --profile clinic issuer issue --document data/vaccination-certificate-unsigned.json --out vaccination-certificate-signed.json // Sign a credential as the clinic and send it to Allison const credentialJson = getVaccineCertUnsignedJSON () const credential = await credentialService . issueCredential ( new IssueRequest () . setDocumentJson ( JSON . stringify ( credentialJson ))); // Set active profile to 'clinic' so we can issue credential signed // with the clinic's signing keys walletService .

These methods can include any message exchange protocol, or a custom transport. In this case, we'll assume that the credential was delivered to Allison in an offline environment. Sending credentials securely is an important part of maintaining the privacy of a credential holder. At this point we do not have a standard way of sending credentials to a wallet. There are a couple of options available. First, if you've onboarded two wallets on the Trinsic platform there is a way to send credentials to a wallet via the wallet's email address. This method is a temporary fix. We recommend using a secure channel of communication within your application for sending and receiving credentials. Sending via https or another encrypted messaging protocol is critical to ensure the personal information inside the credential is not accidentally leaked. As Trinsic's platform develops, we will embed an encrypted messaging protocol called DIDComm (decentralized identifier communication) to exchange credentials between any wallet. Info Dive Deeper: Learn more about how to exchange credentials Store Credential in Wallet \u00b6 Once Allison receives the credential, she or her wallet application can store it within her wallet. She can use any device that she's authorized to use with her wallet. Storing credentials securely is also important to maintaining Allison's privacy.

Info Reference: Insert Record Create a Proof of Vaccination \u00b6 Before boarding an airplane, Allison must show a proof of vaccination. The request for this proof also comes in a form of JSON, in this case a JSON-LD frame. This request can be communicated using any exchange protocol. Again, we'll assume this was done offline. Let's save this request in a file named vaccination-certificate-frame.jsonld vaccination-certificate-frame.jsonld { \"@context\" : [ \"https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1\" , \"https://w3id.org/vaccination/v1\" , \"https://w3id.org/security/bbs/v1\" ], \"type\" : [ \"VerifiableCredential\" , \"VaccinationCertificate\" ], \"@explicit\" : true , \"issuer\" : {}, \"credentialSubject\" : { \"@explicit\" : true , \"@type\" : \"VaccinationEvent\" , \"batchNumber\" : {}, \"countryOfVaccination\" : {} } } This request asks Allison to provide proof of valid vaccination certificate, including the issuer , batchNumber and countryOfVaccination fields. Allison can use the Create Proof functions to build a proof that will share only the requested fields. Now let's create a proof for Allison.

Holder : Stores issued credentials from an issuer. Most often this is the credential subject. Also generates passes to share with verifiers. Issuer : Responsible for issuing signed credentials that attest information about a credential subject Verifier : Verifies passes presented from holders.
